# Development Roadmap

Phases are tackled in order. Each must leave the repository buildable and
playable. A phase is "done" when its systems function in-game **and** round-trip
through save/load.

## Phase 1 — delivered

Core architecture foundation that everything else builds on:

- **EventBus** — typed pub/sub decoupling all systems.
- **ServiceLocator** — registry for world-scoped systems.
- **GameManager / GameState** — top-level flow machine with pause handling.
- **Entity + EntityComponent** — composition-based actor framework.
- **Stats** — `Stat`/`StatModifier`/`AttributeSet`/`StatsComponent` with the
  full modifier pipeline and resource (HP/STA/MP) handling.
- **Save** — `ISaveable` + `SaveManager` writing versioned JSON to `user://`.
- **Sandbox** — `GameBootstrap` + `DebugHud`: a runnable scene that damages,
  heals, kills, respawns, saves, and loads a component-based entity.

## Phase 2 — delivered (Player Controller)

- Generalized the actor framework: `IEntity` interface + shared `EntityNode`
  helpers, so kinematic `CharacterEntity` (CharacterBody3D) and static `Entity`
  (Node3D) are both first-class component hosts. Events now carry `IEntity`.
- `GameInput`: input actions defined in code (WASD, jump, sprint, interact,
  attack, cast, pause) — type-checked, no fragile `project.godot` input block.
- `LocomotionComponent`: reusable ground motor (gravity, accel, jump,
  `MoveAndSlide`) driven by the `MoveSpeed` stat; AI will reuse it.
- `PlayerController`: first-person mouse-look (body yaw + camera pitch), drives
  locomotion, and a melee raycast that feeds the Phase 1 damage pipeline.
- `PlayerFactory`: assembles the player (collision, stats, camera, components).
- Sandbox: player walks the world and can melee the dummy to death; floor and
  dummy now have physics colliders.

## Phase 3 — delivered (Combat Framework)

- `DamageType` + `DamagePacket`/`DamageResult` value types and `CombatMath`
  (attacker-side crit roll & power scaling; defender-side armor mitigation).
- `Hitbox`/`Hurtbox` `Area3D` components on dedicated collision layers
  (`CombatLayers`); hitboxes poll overlaps during their active window and hit
  each target once.
- `CombatComponent`: poise/stagger, blocking, and the defender damage pipeline
  feeding `StatsComponent`; raises `DamageDealtEvent`/`EntityStaggeredEvent`.
- `WeaponResource` (resource-driven) + `MeleeWeaponComponent`: wind-up/active/
  recovery state machine with combos, finishers, stamina cost and attack-speed
  scaling.
- Player wields an Iron Sword (LMB attack, RMB block); the dummy has a hurtbox
  and combat component. `StatsComponent` gained passive stamina/mana regen.

## Phase 4 — delivered (Enemy AI)

- `EnemyEntity` (CharacterEntity) + `PlayerCharacter` marker type so enemies can
  resolve the player distinctly via the `ServiceLocator`.
- `EnemyAIComponent`: an Idle → Patrol → Investigate → Combat → Retreat → Dead
  state machine that reuses `LocomotionComponent` to move and
  `MeleeWeaponComponent` to attack — the same systems the player uses.
- Perception: vision range + FOV cone gated by a line-of-sight raycast, plus a
  short-range proximity sense; tracks a last-known position for investigation.
- Group coordination: spotting the player broadcasts `EnemyAlertedEvent`, pulling
  nearby idle/patrolling allies to investigate.
- Friendly fire prevented via a `Team` on `CombatComponent` honored by hitboxes.
- `EnemyFactory` + `EnemySpawnDirector` maintain a goblin camp population; dead
  enemies despawn and are replaced.
- Player can now be killed by enemies and respawns at the start.

## Phase 5 — delivered (Inventory System)

- `ItemResource` (`.tres`-driven: id, name, type, rarity, stack size, weight,
  value) + `ItemDatabase` that indexes `data/items/` by id for save/loot lookup.
- `ItemStack` runtime quantities; `InventoryComponent` (slot-based, stacking,
  add/remove/count, weight tracking) implementing `ISaveable`.
- `InteractableComponent` interaction base + raycast `interact` in the player
  controller; `ItemPickupComponent`/`ItemPickupFactory` for world pickups.
- `InventoryPanel` UI (toggle with `I`); goblins drop hide/gold on death.

## Phase 6 — next steps (Equipment System)

1. `EquipmentSlot` enum (MainHand, OffHand, Head, Chest, ...) + `EquippableItem`
   data (slot, stat modifiers, weapon/armor link) layered over `ItemResource`.
2. `EquipmentComponent`: equip/unequip applying `StatModifier`s (source = item)
   to the `StatsComponent`; swap the active `WeaponResource` on the weapon.
3. Equip from the inventory UI; reflect equipped gear in stats/combat.
4. Save/load equipped items; foundation for loot affixes (Phase 7).
