# Embervale — Session Playbook (the day-by-day breakdown)

> **What this is.** [`PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md`](PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md) lays out the
> *phases* (22–66) and the five gates. Each of those phases is far too large to
> finish in a single Claude Code session — they were written as milestones, not
> work units. **This document breaks every phase into lettered sub-phases
> (22A, 22B, 22C …)**, each one sized to fit comfortably inside a *single
> session/context window* and to leave the repo **buildable and playable at the
> end** (CLAUDE.md §1).
>
> Work it **top to bottom**. Open a session, pick the next unchecked sub-phase,
> do *only* that sub-phase, satisfy its **Done when** bar, commit, and stop.
> One sub-phase ≈ one session ≈ one small PR (or one commit on the phase's PR).

---

## 0. How to use this playbook

### 0.1 The session loop (do this every time)

1. **Pick** the next unchecked `[ ]` sub-phase in order. Do not skip ahead — the
   ordering encodes dependencies.
2. **Read** the sub-phase's *Goal*, *Tasks*, and *Done when*. Read the linked
   CLAUDE.md §8 recipe and the relevant `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` section **before**
   touching code.
3. **Do** only that sub-phase. If you discover it's two sessions of work, split
   it: do the first half, append a new lettered sub-phase for the remainder, and
   stop.
4. **Verify** the *Done when* bar. Run `validate` (and any new validators) in the
   dev console mentally/against the API — this container can't build (CLAUDE.md
   §2), so "verified" means *reviewed against the Godot 4.7 C# API*, never "ran
   it."
5. **Persist** — if the sub-phase added stateful data, it implements `ISaveable`
   and round-trips *before* you call it done (CLAUDE.md §1).
6. **Commit** with a clear message; tick the box here and update the phase's row
   in `PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md` §11 if the whole phase closed. Push; open/append the
   draft PR (CLAUDE.md §9).
7. **Stop.** Don't roll two sub-phases into one session unless the second is
   trivially small (a doc tweak, a `.tres` you already have all the data for).

### 0.2 Sub-phase sizing rules (what fits in one session)

A sub-phase is correctly sized when it is **one** of:

- **One new component/service** + its events + its save hook + wiring into *one*
  factory/scene. (Not three components.)
- **One new resource type** (`XxxResource` + its `XxxDatabase` + auto-index) with
  *one* authored example `.tres` and the recipe doc entry.
- **A batch of pure content** (`.tres` only, no code) — e.g. "author 6 enemy
  `.tres` against the existing factory" — capped so the batch is reviewable.
- **One UI panel/widget** built through `UiTheme`.
- **One integration/QA pass** over a bounded slice (one region, one quest line).

If a task needs *new code in three+ systems at once*, it is a phase, not a
sub-phase — split it.

### 0.3 Tags (carried from the roadmap)

**[F]** new engine/feature code · **[C]** content authoring (mostly `.tres`) ·
**[P]** production craft (art/audio/UX/perf/ship). Most sub-phases blend; the tag
marks the centre of gravity. **[C]** sub-phases are the cheapest sessions (data,
no code) — batch them when momentum is good.

### 0.4 Legend

- `[ ]` not started · `[~]` in progress (split mid-session) · `[x]` done.
- **DoD** = the phase-level Definition of Done in `PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md` §0.3.
  Every sub-phase inherits it; the **Done when** line is the sub-phase's *extra*
  bar on top of "it builds, it's playable, it saves, `validate` is green."

# Stage A — Pre-production & First Playable (→ G0)

---

## Phase 22 — Production Bible & Content Pipeline `[F/P]`

> Make authoring fast, safe, and consistent *before* there's a lot of content.
> Mostly tooling and docs — low engine risk, high leverage.

- [x] **22A — `docs/DESIGN.md`: combat & moment-to-moment pillars** `[P]`
  - **Goal:** pin the design the LORE leaves open, starting with combat.
  - **Tasks:** create `docs/DESIGN.md`; write the *combat pillars* (Skyrim breadth
    × Elden Ring weight, "no button mashing"), the core moment-to-moment loop
    (explore → fight → loot → grow), and the input/feel intent that Phase 29 will
    answer to. Cross-link CLAUDE.md combat sections.
  - **Done when:** `docs/DESIGN.md` exists with the Combat + Core Loop sections
    filled; no code touched.

- [x] **22B — `docs/DESIGN.md`: progression, difficulty & economy intent** `[P]`
  - **Goal:** finish the design bible's remaining pillars.
  - **Tasks:** add *Progression* (no class lock, player-authored builds, perk
    intent), *Difficulty philosophy* (easy to learn / hard to master, options not
    class locks), *Corruption fantasy* (sets up Phase 23), and *Economy intent*
    (gold sinks, scarcity in a dying world).
  - **Done when:** all five pillar sections complete; this is the document
    balancers/authors answer to.

- [x] **22C — ID & naming registry doc + audit** `[F/P]`
  - **Goal:** one documented namespace scheme for every content domain.
  - **Tasks:** locate the existing central id constants (PR #31). Write
    `docs/IDS.md` (or a section in DESIGN) documenting the scheme for `item.*`,
    `quest.*`, `npc.*`, `region.*`, `boss.*`, `faction.*`, `relic.*`, `dialogue.*`,
    `flag.*`, `spell.*`, `recipe.*`, etc. Audit current `data/**.tres` ids for
    conformance; list violators.
  - **Done when:** the scheme is documented and current ids are audited against it
    (a short conformance list in the doc).

- [x] **22D — `ContentValidator`: structural rules (no dead refs → well-formed)** `[F]`
  - **Goal:** grow validation from "references resolve" to "content is well-formed."
  - **Tasks:** in the `ContentValidator`, add checks: no duplicate ids per domain;
    loot tables non-empty; every quest objective `TargetId` resolves; every
    dialogue `Goto`/`StartNodeId` resolves. Read `src/Debugging/` for the existing
    validator shape first.
  - **Done when:** new rules implemented and surfaced; running `validate` reports
    the new classes of error.

- [x] **22E — `ContentValidator`: graph reachability (quests + dialogue)** `[F]`
  - **Goal:** catch unreachable content, the subtle content-scale bug.
  - **Tasks:** add reachability analysis — dialogue graphs have no orphan nodes
    and no dead ends that aren't intentional terminals; quest objective chains are
    completable; prerequisite quest chains don't cycle. Add a `validate-all`
    console command that runs the full battery.
  - **Done when:** `validate-all` exists and flags an intentionally-broken test
    graph; no false positives on current content.

- [x] **22F — Headless validation entry point** `[F]`
  - **Goal:** let the maintainer run validation without launching into gameplay.
  - **Tasks:** add a headless/`--validate` path (a Godot `--headless` script or a
    `GameState` boot branch) that loads the databases, runs `validate-all`, prints
    a report, and exits non-zero on failure. Document the invocation in CLAUDE.md
    §3 and the README.
  - **Done when:** a documented one-command content check exists (reviewed against
    the API; the human runs it).

- [x] **22G — `data/_templates/` canonical starting `.tres`** `[P]`
  - **Goal:** copy-paste starting points for every content type.
  - **Tasks:** create `data/_templates/` with one minimal, commented `.tres`
    exemplar per content domain already in CLAUDE.md §8 (item, equippable, affix,
    loot table, perk, quest, dialogue, schedule, weather, encounter, world event,
    recipe, spell, status effect, faction). Each is the recipe's "canonical
    starting point."
  - **Done when:** every §8 domain has a template; `validate` stays green
    (templates either valid or excluded by an `_` convention).

- [x] **22H — Telemetry/analytics spine (dev-only)** `[F]`
  - **Goal:** lightweight event logging so balance/QA later have data.
  - **Tasks:** add `AnalyticsEvent : IGameEvent` and a dev-only `AnalyticsSink`
    that subscribes to the EventBus and logs to `user://analytics/` (deaths by
    location, quest start/complete, level-ups). Gated off by default in retail via
    a build/Settings flag. Implement `ISaveable` only if it must persist across
    sessions (it shouldn't — it's a log).
  - **Done when:** dev builds emit a structured analytics log; retail path is a
    no-op; documented in ARCHITECTURE.

---

## Phase 23 — The Corruption System `[F]`

> The LORE's **defining mechanic**. The single most important new system in the
> whole production roadmap; the slice and all narrative gate on it. Build the core
> first, then wire one consequence per session.

- [x] **23A — `CorruptionComponent` core + events + save** `[F]`
  - **Goal:** the 0–100 meter and tier state, persistent.
  - **Tasks:** add `src/Corruption/CorruptionComponent.cs` (`EntityComponent`,
    `[GlobalClass]`, on the player). 0–100 value; `Add/Set` API; a `CorruptionTier`
    enum (Untainted → Touched → Marked → Ashbound → Embers) with thresholds.
    Fire `CorruptionChangedEvent` and `CorruptionTierChangedEvent` in a new
    `CorruptionEvents.cs`. Implement `ISaveable` (stable `SaveId`), register in
    `OnInitialize`, unregister in `OnTeardown`. Add to `PlayerFactory`.
  - **Done when:** corruption can be raised/queried in code, fires tier events at
    thresholds, and round-trips save/load. (CLAUDE.md §8 "new component" + "new
    persistent system" + "new event".)

- [x] **23B — Corruption dev console + debug surface** `[F]`
  - **Goal:** make it testable before it has any visual.
  - **Tasks:** register a `corruption` console command (`get` / `set N` / `add N`
    / `tier`) per CLAUDE.md §8 "new dev-console command," resolving the player via
    `ServiceLocator`. Add a line to the F3 debug overlay showing value + tier.
  - **Done when:** the maintainer can drive corruption from `F1` and watch it on
    F3.

- [x] **23C — Dialogue conditions/effects for corruption** `[F]`
  - **Goal:** let conversations gate and modify corruption.
  - **Tasks:** extend `DialogueEnums.cs` with `Condition` `CorruptionAtLeast` /
    `CorruptionBelow` and `Effect` `AddCorruption`. Wire evaluation in the dialogue
    session runner against `CorruptionComponent`. Author one test dialogue using
    each. (Extends CLAUDE.md §8 "new conversation"; read `src/Dialogue/` first.)
  - **Done when:** a conversation visibly branches on corruption and a choice can
    raise it; `validate` understands the new enum values.

- [x] **23D — Corruption UI: character-screen gauge** `[F]`
  - **Goal:** the player can see their corruption.
  - **Tasks:** add a corruption gauge to the character screen via `UiTheme.Bar`
    (CLAUDE.md §8 "new UI panel"). Label the current tier. Rebuild from a dirty
    flag in `_Process`, never in a signal handler.
  - **Done when:** the gauge reflects live corruption + tier through `UiTheme`.

- [x] **23E — Corruption HUD vignette at high tiers** `[F/P]`
  - **Goal:** ambient dread at Ashbound/Embers.
  - **Tasks:** add a subtle screen vignette/desaturation overlay in `GameHud` that
    fades in by tier (subscribe to `CorruptionTierChangedEvent`). Keep it through
    `UiTheme` palette; intensity is data-light and tweakable.
  - **Done when:** crossing into high tiers visibly shifts the screen; reverting
    lowers it.

- [x] **23F — `CorruptionAppearanceController` (hook stub)** `[F]`
  - **Goal:** the seam the future model/VFX work plugs into.
  - **Tasks:** add a `CorruptionAppearanceController` on the player that, per tier,
    swaps a placeholder material/emissive (eye glow, ash-vein tint) on whatever
    player mesh exists now. Drive it off the tier event. Designed so Phase 30 can
    replace placeholders with real materials without changing the wiring.
  - **Done when:** each tier shows a *distinct* placeholder appearance change;
    documented as the hook for Phase 30.

- [ ] **23G — NPC reaction / global "dread" standing** `[F]`
  - **Goal:** the world fears a corrupted player.
  - **Tasks:** have `ReputationComponent`/faction AI read corruption as a global
    standing modifier ("dread") so high corruption nudges NPC hostility/dialogue.
    Reuse the existing reputation math; don't add a parallel system. (Read
    `src/Factions/`.)
  - **Done when:** raising corruption measurably shifts at least one faction's
    standing/AI reaction; round-trips through save.

- [ ] **23H — Corrupted ability gating + both-endings eligibility hook** `[F/C]`
  - **Goal:** corruption unlocks corrupted variants and feeds the endings dial.
  - **Tasks:** add a corruption-tier gate option to `SpellResource`/`PerkResource`
    consumption (author one corrupted spell + one corrupted perk `.tres` gated by
    tier — CLAUDE.md §8 recipes, no new system). Expose a
    `CorruptionComponent.EndingEligibility` read (Dawnfire vs Lord of Embers
    threshold) that Phase 49 will consume. Document the contract.
  - **Done when:** a tier-gated spell/perk is learnable only above its tier; an
    ending-eligibility value is queryable and saved.

---

## Phase 24 — Meta-Shell & Localization Spine `[F]`

> The title/menu/settings/save-slot shell the systems roadmap excluded, plus the
> i18n layer that must land *before* mass content authoring.

- [ ] **24A — `MainMenu` scene + `GameState.MainMenu` boot** `[F]`
  - **Goal:** the game boots to a menu, not straight into the sandbox.
  - **Tasks:** add a `MainMenu` scene (New Game / Continue / Load / Settings /
    Quit, built through `UiTheme`). Make `GameBootstrap`/`GameManager` boot into
    `GameState.MainMenu` and transition to `Playing` on New Game/Continue. Keep the
    sandbox reachable (New Game → existing bootstrap path).
  - **Done when:** launching shows the menu; New Game enters the world; Quit exits.
    No save logic yet (buttons can be stubbed/disabled).

- [ ] **24B — `SaveManager`: single-file → slot directories** `[F]`
  - **Goal:** multiple independent saves.
  - **Tasks:** refactor `SaveManager` from one file to `user://saves/<slot>/`.
    Add slot create/list/delete and a save *header* (region, level, playtime,
    corruption tier, timestamp). Keep `ISaveable` registration API unchanged.
    Read `src/Save/` first; preserve back-compat or write a one-time migration.
  - **Done when:** multiple slots coexist; F5/F9 still work against the active
    slot; headers populate.

- [ ] **24C — Save-slot UI (New/Load/Continue + metadata)** `[F]`
  - **Goal:** the player manages saves from the shell.
  - **Tasks:** build the slot-select panel (list slots with header metadata +
    screenshot thumbnail; New into empty slot; Load; Delete with confirm). Wire
    Continue = most-recent slot. Capture a screenshot on save for the thumbnail.
  - **Done when:** full new/continue/load/delete flow works from the menu through
    `UiTheme`, round-tripping real saves.

- [ ] **24D — Autosave + quicksave + manual cadence** `[F]`
  - **Goal:** robust save cadence on top of slots.
  - **Tasks:** add autosave triggers (region change, major quest beat, time
    interval) writing to a rotating autosave slot; keep quicksave (F5/F9) and
    manual save-from-pause. Guard against saving mid-cutscene/load.
  - **Done when:** autosave/quicksave/manual all target the slot system safely; no
    double-save races.

- [ ] **24E — `Settings` resource + `SettingsService`** `[F]`
  - **Goal:** persisted options applied at runtime.
  - **Tasks:** add a `Settings` resource (graphics, audio bus volumes, controls,
    gameplay, accessibility placeholders) persisted to `user://settings.tres` via
    a `SettingsService` (`ServiceLocator`-registered). Apply on boot.
  - **Done when:** settings persist across launches and apply on load; audio-bus
    fields are ready for Phase 31 to consume.

- [ ] **24F — Settings UI panel** `[F]`
  - **Goal:** the options menu.
  - **Tasks:** build the Settings panel (tabs/sections for Graphics/Audio/Controls/
    Gameplay/Accessibility) through `UiTheme`, reading/writing `SettingsService`.
    Reachable from both MainMenu and PauseMenu.
  - **Done when:** changing a setting applies live and persists; reachable from
    both shells.

- [ ] **24G — Localization spine: `Loc` facade + translation pipeline** `[F]`
  - **Goal:** every string goes through a key from here on.
  - **Tasks:** add a `Loc` static facade over Godot's `TranslationServer`; set up
    the `.po`/CSV pipeline and an `en` base catalogue. Document the rule in
    CLAUDE.md (§6 conventions) and PRODUCTION_ROADMAP DoD #6: **no hard-coded
    player-facing strings after this lands.**
  - **Done when:** `Loc.T("key")` resolves from the catalogue; the convention is
    documented.

- [ ] **24H — Retrofit shell strings through `Loc`** `[F]`
  - **Goal:** prove the layer end-to-end on real UI.
  - **Tasks:** route all MainMenu/Settings/PauseMenu/save-slot strings through
    `Loc` keys; add them to the `en` catalogue. This is the template every later
    UI follows.
  - **Done when:** the shell has zero hard-coded display strings; switching the
    catalogue language visibly changes them.

---

## Phase 25 — Region Streaming & World Map `[F]`

> Replace the single flat sandbox with streamed authored regions, a map, and
> fast travel — before authoring four realms.

- [ ] **25A — `RegionResource` + region scene convention** `[F]`
  - **Goal:** regions are authorable data + scenes.
  - **Tasks:** add `RegionResource` (`.tres`: id, display name, realm, sub-cell
    list, bounds, default weather/day-phase bias, neighbour links) + a
    `RegionDatabase` auto-index. Define the region/sub-cell scene naming + placement
    convention (world-partition discipline) in a doc. Author one `RegionResource`
    for the current sandbox.
  - **Done when:** the sandbox is described by a `RegionResource`; the convention
    is documented for Phases 27/44.

- [ ] **25B — `RegionStreamer`: load/unload by distance** `[F]`
  - **Goal:** stream sub-cells around the player with a budget.
  - **Tasks:** add `RegionStreamer` that loads/unloads sub-cell scenes by distance
    with hysteresis and a per-frame instancing budget (don't hitch). Reuse the
    Phase 19 pooling/throttle discipline. Keep the current sandbox working as a
    single always-loaded cell.
  - **Done when:** moving across cell boundaries loads/unloads without a visible
    hitch (reviewed against the API); the sandbox still boots.

- [ ] **25C — Hard transitions + loading screen (realm-to-realm)** `[F]`
  - **Goal:** discrete loads between realms.
  - **Tasks:** add a loading-screen state (`GameState.Loading` already exists) for
    hard transitions; tear down the old region, load the new, restore the player.
    Trigger via a transition volume/door interactable.
  - **Done when:** stepping through a transition runs a clean load and spawns the
    player correctly in the new region.

- [ ] **25D — Persistent actors across streaming (PersistentSpawnDirector)** `[F]`
  - **Goal:** the world remembers itself across load/unload.
  - **Tasks:** ensure streamed-in actors with `PersistentId` restore their state
    via the existing `PersistentSpawnDirector` (PR #29) when their cell reloads
    (dead enemies stay dead, looted chests stay looted). Read `src/Save/` first.
  - **Done when:** kill/loot an actor, leave the cell, return — state persists;
    round-trips through a full save/load too.

- [ ] **25E — World map data + screen** `[F]`
  - **Goal:** a data-driven map.
  - **Tasks:** build a map screen from region metadata + discovered POIs (a
    `MapMarker` data list), rendered through `UiTheme`. Fog/undiscovered regions
    hidden until visited. `ISaveable` discovery state.
  - **Done when:** the map shows visited regions/POIs and persists discovery.

- [ ] **25F — HUD compass + quest markers** `[F]`
  - **Goal:** on-screen wayfinding.
  - **Tasks:** add a compass strip to `GameHud` showing cardinal headings, nearby
    discovered POIs, and the active quest objective marker (read the quest log).
    Through `UiTheme`/`GameHud`.
  - **Done when:** the compass tracks heading and points at the active objective.

- [ ] **25G — Fast-travel graph** `[F]`
  - **Goal:** travel between discovered nodes.
  - **Tasks:** add discoverable travel nodes (interactables that register on the
    map), a fast-travel action from the map screen (gated by discovery), and
    arrival that respects clock/weather. Reuse the hard-transition load path (25C).
  - **Done when:** discovering and selecting a travel node moves the player there
    via a clean load; discovery + node list persist.

---

## Phase 26 — Playable Races & Character Creation `[F]`

> Six LORE races as data-driven trait sets + a creator that writes them into the
> player at spawn.

- [ ] **26A — `RaceResource` + `RaceDatabase`** `[F]`
  - **Goal:** races are data.
  - **Tasks:** add `RaceResource` (`.tres`: id, name, `AttributeSet` deltas, innate
    perk/ability ids, starting reputation tweaks, appearance option ids) +
    auto-indexed `RaceDatabase` (mirror `ItemDatabase`). No new inheritance.
  - **Done when:** a `RaceResource` loads and indexes; the schema covers all six
    LORE races' needs.

- [ ] **26B — Author the six race `.tres`** `[C]`
  - **Goal:** Human, Valari, Grondar, Sylthari, Draekyn, Umbral exist as data.
  - **Tasks:** author all six `data/races/*.tres` per LORE traits (Valari magic
    affinity, Grondar strength/endurance, Sylthari wildlife communion, Draekyn
    dragon ability seed, Umbral stealth, Human flexible). Reference existing
    perks/stats; create any small new perk `.tres` they need (CLAUDE.md §8 "new
    perk"). Pure content.
  - **Done when:** six valid race `.tres`; `validate` green; traits reference real
    ids.

- [ ] **26C — `PlayerFactory` consumes a creation profile** `[F]`
  - **Goal:** the chosen race actually shapes the player.
  - **Tasks:** add a `CharacterProfile` (race id, name, appearance, background) and
    have `PlayerFactory` apply race deltas as `StatModifier`s, seed innate perks,
    and apply reputation tweaks at spawn (CLAUDE.md §6 factory rules — set props
    before `AddChild`). Persist the profile in the save header.
  - **Done when:** spawning with different races yields different starting stats/
    perks/standing; the profile saves/loads.

- [ ] **26D — `CharacterCreator` screen** `[F]`
  - **Goal:** the new-game creation flow.
  - **Tasks:** build the creator (race pick with trait summary, appearance options,
    name, optional background) through `UiTheme`, fed by `RaceDatabase`, writing a
    `CharacterProfile`. Hook it into MainMenu → New Game → world spawn. All strings
    via `Loc`.
  - **Done when:** New Game → create a character → spawn into the world with the
    chosen race applied; flow round-trips through the save header.

---

## Phase 27 — First Playable Region: Ember Crown `[C/P]`

> Author **one real region** end-to-end to prove the pipeline produces
> ship-quality space. Mostly content + first-pass art, on top of streaming (25).

- [ ] **27A — Ember Crown layout greybox + region/cell setup** `[C/P]`
  - **Goal:** the spatial shell, streamed.
  - **Tasks:** lay out a walkable Ember Crown slice as `RegionResource` + sub-cell
    scenes (town hub footprint, surrounding wilds), navmesh baked, transitions to
    neighbours stubbed. Greybox geometry only.
  - **Done when:** you can walk the whole region with streaming + navmesh working.

- [ ] **27B — Town hub: vendors, inn, guild presence, crafting stations** `[C]`
  - **Goal:** a living hub.
  - **Tasks:** place vendor NPCs (stub shops until Phase 38), an inn, a guild
    presence marker, and `CraftingStationFactory` stations (forge/workbench/
    alchemy). Use existing factories/components; author the NPC `Entity`s with
    colliders + interactables.
  - **Done when:** the hub has functioning crafting stations and interactable NPCs;
    `validate` green.

- [ ] **27C — Scheduled NPC population** `[C]`
  - **Goal:** the hub feels inhabited.
  - **Tasks:** author `ScheduleResource`s and attach `ScheduleComponent`s to hub
    NPCs (home → work → tavern → sleep routines) per CLAUDE.md §8 "new NPC
    routine." Give 3–5 named NPCs full day routines.
  - **Done when:** NPCs walk believable daily routines off the `WorldClock`.

- [ ] **27D — Wilds: encounters, POIs, loot** `[C]`
  - **Goal:** the explorable surround.
  - **Tasks:** author `EncounterResource`s for the wilds (goblins/wildlife), place
    POIs (a ruin, a cache, a mini-camp) with `LootComponent` droppers and
    interactables. Day-phase-appropriate encounter flags. Pure content.
  - **Done when:** the wilds spawn encounters and reward exploration; loot drops
    and persists.

- [ ] **27E — Starter quest chain in the Ember Crown** `[C]`
  - **Goal:** a real questline to play.
  - **Tasks:** author a 3–4 quest chain (Kill/Collect for now; richer types come in
    Phase 41) with `QuestGiverComponent`/`DialogueComponent` givers, prerequisite
    chaining, and rewards. All dialogue/quest strings via `Loc`.
  - **Done when:** the chain is startable, advanceable, and completable end-to-end;
    `validate-all` green.

- [ ] **27F — First-pass ambience, lighting & audio bed** `[P]`
  - **Goal:** the quality bar, first pass.
  - **Tasks:** set day/night lighting mood, weather bias, and a first-pass ambience
    bed (placeholder audio is fine pre-Phase 31). Establish the dying-world palette
    in this region as the reference for all later regions.
  - **Done when:** the region reads as a *place* with mood, not greybox; documented
    as the bar.

---

## Phase 28 — First Boss: a Fallen Flamebearer (Iron King slice) `[F/C]`

> One full multi-phase boss to build and prove boss tooling ahead of Phase 36, and
> to wire the defeat → reward → corruption-gain loop.

- [ ] **28A — Iron King actor + arena** `[F/C]`
  - **Goal:** the boss exists in a space.
  - **Tasks:** build the Iron King as a `CharacterEntity` via a boss factory
    (mirror `EnemyFactory`): stats `AttributeSet`, `CombatComponent` (Team), a
    weapon, hurt/hitboxes, AI behaviour. Build an arena sub-cell with an entry
    trigger. Register in `ServiceLocator` if the boss bar needs it.
  - **Done when:** you can enter the arena and fight a functional (single-phase)
    Iron King.

- [ ] **28B — Multi-phase behaviour + telegraphed attacks** `[F]`
  - **Goal:** phases and readable wind-ups.
  - **Tasks:** add HP-threshold phase transitions (e.g. 66%/33%) that change the
    ability set, and telegraphed wind-up timing on heavy attacks (the "no
    button-mashing" feel). Keep it data-light but real; this becomes the seed for
    `BossController` in Phase 36 — note the generalizable bits.
  - **Done when:** the fight has ≥2 distinct phases with telegraphed attacks.

- [ ] **28C — Boss healthbar + intro/defeat sequencing** `[F]`
  - **Goal:** the boss UI/flow beats.
  - **Tasks:** add a boss healthbar to `GameHud` (through `UiTheme`), a short intro
    lock and a defeat sequence (slow-mo/fade hook for Phase 43 cinematics later).

## Appendix — keeping this playbook honest

- **Re-derive sizing as you go.** If a sub-phase repeatedly overflows a session,
  the *next* time you hit its sibling, split it pre-emptively and update this file.
- **This file is the live tracker.** Tick boxes here per session; mirror only the
  *phase-level* status into `PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md` §11 so the two don't drift.
- **The gates are real.** Don't open a stage's first sub-phase until the prior
  gate's criteria are maintainer-verified in a build (CLAUDE.md §2 — this
  container can't build; "verified" = the human confirmed it).
- **Every sub-phase still owes the full DoD** (`PRODUCTION_ROADMAP.md` §0.3):
  builds, playable, `ISaveable` round-trips, `validate-all` green, docs updated,
  draft PR. The **Done when** line is *extra*, not instead.
